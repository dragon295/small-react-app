            <br />
            We may personalise the services we provide to you based on the
            combined data we have collected about you (for instance, we may use
            your IP address to display content relevant for your area or we may
            recommend or to help you discover new games or social media that you
            are entitled to play and watch using information about your past

            communications, the time and location of your activities, and your
            Abstraction Online Account, registered account details and IP

            <br />
            We may use the combined data we collect for auditing, compliance and
            legal purposes (for example, making or defending claims or
            activities that are required by law).

            We might target and personalise our marketing communications,
            purchase recommendations and adverts that we display on our and
            third party websites and services based on the combined data we have
            collected about you (e.g. to avoid displaying content you've already
            purchased from our store).
            <br />
            <br />
            You may notice this personalisation when you visit Abstraction (via
            website or app), when we send you marketing communications or when
            you visit our and third party websites (such as social network
            sites) that show purchase recommendations or adverts from us (for
            example, you might see an advert for a game similar to one you have
            played recently or a product that you have recently viewed on
            Abstraction).
            <br />

            from us relating to Abstraction and our products and services. If
            you later decide not to receive marketing emails from us, you can
            turn off marketing communications:

            We keep the data that we collect about you for as long as necessary
            for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. In general, we will
            retain information that is associated with your account or device
            until you close your account. Even following account closure, please
            be aware that the data that we collect about you may still be

            safe and do not disclose it to anyone else. Consider ensuring
            automatic account log in setting is disabled and the setting
            requiring a password to be entered before completing purchases is

            others. You should contact Abstraction Help and Support immediately
            if you become aware of any unauthorised use of your account or other
            security breach.
